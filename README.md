# Mini-Battleship Game

Created my own small version of the classic board game Battleship for a bootcamp assignment. This is a terminal-based game that currently only handled the player's turn as that was the requirement of the project.

## Future Project Goals

- Add Terminal GUI to represent game board
- Add computer turn to simulate multiplayer

## Made With

- Node.js
- readline-sync

## How to Play

1. Open the folder in your IDE.
2. Open the terminal.
3. Install packages:
```
npm i
```
4. Run game:
```
node part2.js
```

Let me know what you think!

I already got some feedback from the instruction about increasing my usage of the Single Responsibility Principle in some places, but would welcome some additional feedback!

Happy Coding!
